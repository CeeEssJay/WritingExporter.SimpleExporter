# WritingExporter.SimpleExporter
Tool for exporting interactive stories from Writing.com, and exporting them to human-readable files.

This project was started after some stories were taken down and could not be recovered. The hope is that no decent story is ever lost again.

### Installing

Simple unpack the files into a folder on your computer, and run the executable.

It may require the .NET framework to be up-to-date.

## Usage
